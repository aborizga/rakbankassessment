***************************How TO handle Secrets*****************************

1- aws account access and secret key were added to github secrets ( uses to connect to aws services)
steps:
	1-go to github repo setting
	2-open secrets tap
	3-add secret name and values
	4-call any needed secret as avariable ( example ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}


2- terraform code require access (access and secret key), the are located is tfvars file witch is not
   uploaded to the github or any repo, because we will run the code from our labtop, if you want to run the code 
   from aws or any bation host you just need Iam role to allow reaching all the needed services.

3- for terraform: create var.tfvars on your root directory and add aws secret and access key .
add var.tfvars to .gitignore since it contain sensative data
